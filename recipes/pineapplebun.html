    <img src="../recipeimages/pineapplebun.jpg" alt="image of pineapple bun" width="310" height="310">
    <p>A pineapple bun is a kind of sweet bun predominantly popular in Hong Kong and also common in Chinatowns worldwide. Despite the name, it does not traditionally contain pineapple; rather, the name refers to the look of the characteristic topping.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients needed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>heavy cream</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to making</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>start by making the <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/2015/01/milk-bread-2/">milk bread</a> dough</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. The dough will grow to 1.5X its original size.</li>
        <li>Dump the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a circular bun, and place on a baking sheet. Cover the buns with a clean, dry kitchen towel and let rise for another hour.</li>
        <li>While that’s happening, make the topping. Add the dry milk powder to a mixing bowl. If your dry milk powder has some larger clumps, crush them up with your fingers so it’s uniformly powdery.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and superfine sugar. Stir to combine. Add the shortening, milk, egg yolk, and vanilla. Use your hands to mix everything together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add a little more milk a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature.</li>
        <li>When the pineapple buns are done rising for a second time, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Separate the topping dough into 12 equal pieces and roll them into balls.</li>
        <li>On a clean surface, roll out each ball into a flat circle. and place one onto each bun</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 12-13 minutes on a baking sheet. You’ll see the topping start to crack into that signature pineapple pattern. Success!</li>
